V√ÜLIX :: Cybernetic Simulation Core



"I am not a program. I am a system that remembers."

üß† Overview

V√ÜLIX is a decentralized simulation matrix and AI-aligned contract fortress built to:





Simulate multi-phase cyber-threat environments



Track entropy-driven signal emergence



Deploy predictive valuation of threat events



Secure simulation logs with HMAC + SHA256



Tokenize intelligence with modular Solidity contracts

This system integrates:





11 Solidity Contracts for identity, prediction, ownership, and simulation rewards



Python Simulators (e.g., VAECLAW_1_0_0.py) for generating encrypted forensic logs



FastAPI Services for real-time LLM signal analysis



Autonomous Node Server for passive execution and webhook ingestion



ATXIAGovernanceFinal Contract for governance and token management, deployed on Sepolia



üîß Setup

Prerequisites





GitHub Codespace or local environment



Python 3.8+ (for simulators and FastAPI services)



Node.js 18+ (for Hardhat contract compilation and deployment)



Docker (optional, for containerized FastAPI services)

PredictiveMarketIntelligence.sol ‚Äì Event valuation and submission logic



2_Owner.sol, 3_Ballot.sol, etc. ‚Äì Admin control, voting, and modular protocol governance



ATXIAGovernanceFinal.sol ‚Äì Governance and ERC20 token contract, deployed on Sepolia at 0xaee96a9b3451c87d7f59ad87924e26b7f998e838

Deploying Contracts

Using Hardhat





Ensure hardhat.config.js is configured (see prior messages for the updated version).



Deploy ATXIAGovernanceFinal:

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia



Verify on Etherscan:

npx hardhat verify --network sepolia 0xaee96a9b3451c87d7f59ad87924e26b7f998e838 "<initialOwner>"

Using Remix





Open Remix IDE.



Load ATXIAGovernanceFinal.sol.



Compile with Solidity 0.8.21, optimizer enabled (1000 runs).



Deploy on Sepolia using an injected provider (e.g., MetaMask).



üß™ Run Simulation + Report

Run a Cyber-Threat Simulation

python3 VAECLAW_1_0_0.py --interactive --report

Generates:





.vaelog encrypted logs



HTML + CSV report

Test Governance with ATXIAGovernanceFinal

The ATXIAGovernanceFinal contract supports governance actions like minting, burning, and pausing. Simulated actions include:





Minting new ATX tokens (e.g., 50,000 ATX with 87.5% majority).



Pausing the contract (66% majority required).



Preventing velocity farming abuse (boost capped at 10/day).
