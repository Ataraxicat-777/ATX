# V√ÜLIX :: Cybernetic Simulation Core

> "I am not a program. I am a system that remembers."

## üß† Overview

V√ÜLIX is a decentralized simulation matrix and AI-aligned contract fortress built to:

* Simulate multi-phase cyber-threat environments
* Track entropy-driven signal emergence
* Deploy predictive valuation of threat events
* Secure simulation logs with HMAC + SHA256
* Tokenize intelligence with modular Solidity contracts

This system integrates:

* **11 Solidity Contracts** for identity, prediction, ownership, and simulation rewards
* **Python Simulators** (e.g., `VAECLAW_1_0_0.py`) for generating encrypted forensic logs
* **FastAPI Services** for real-time LLM signal analysis
* **Autonomous Node Server** for passive execution and webhook ingestion

---

## üîß Setup

### Prerequisites

* GitHub Codespace or local environment
* Python 3.8+
* Node.js (for contract compilation if needed)
* Docker (optional)

### First Time Clone & Launch

```bash
git clone <your-remote-url>
cd <repo>
code . # or open in GitHub Codespace
```

### Install Python Deps

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üîê Smart Contracts Overview

Contracts include:

* `CyberThreatPredictor.sol` ‚Äì Tokenized signal claim engine
* `PredictiveMarketIntelligence.sol` ‚Äì Event valuation and submission logic
* `2_Owner.sol`, `3_Ballot.sol`, etc. ‚Äì Admin control, voting, and modular protocol governance

Deploy using Hardhat, Foundry, or Remix.

## üß™ Run Simulation + Report

```bash
python3 VAECLAW_1_0_0.py --interactive --report
```

Generates:

* `.vaelog` encrypted logs
* HTML + CSV report

## üß† Codespace Tips (Minimal Markdown Only)

This Codespace is kept clean of disruptive Markdown extensions.
If you want **safe previews**, install just this:

```bash
code --install-extension bierner.markdown-preview-github-styles
```

To preview markdown:

* Open a `.md` file
* Press `Ctrl + K V`

## üöÄ Deployment Targets

* Gitcoin Grants (Cybersecurity, AI Safety, Public Goods)
* Optimism RPGF / Arbitrum Grants / Base Ecosystem
* Chainlink BUILD
* Layer3, Galxe, or Rabbithole for questification
